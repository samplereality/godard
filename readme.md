# Robot Daze

_Robot Daze_ is small webtoy that uses RiTa to tell a story about a girl and her robot.
I put together the files here on Glitch as templates for participants in my creative coding classes and workshops to use.

## Getting Started

If you're reading this, you've probably already created an account on Glitch. Next you have to "remix" this project, which clones it to your own account.
From there you can begin editing the files. There are three files you'll need to work with at a minimum.

### index.html

index.html is the HTML file that contains standard HTML. You'll definitely want to change the title, button text, and about section, at a minimum.

### grammar.js

The grammar.js file contains your actual RiTa grammar. Check out Daniel Howe's [documentation on grammars in RiTa](https://observablehq.com/@dhowe/tut-rita-grammars). 

### style.css

The style.css file is where you change the look of your project. Even if you don't know CSS, you should be able to muck around enough to change fonts, colors, and margins.

You can find some tips on [styling CSS](https://courses.digitaldavidson.net/elit20/styling-tracery/) on one of my course sites.

### Assets

You can also drag and drop or upload images into the "assets" folder to include in your project.

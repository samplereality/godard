# The Godard Plot Generator

_The Godard Plot Generator_ is an implementation of an experiment Umberto Eco proposes in his 1963 book _Misreadings_. Eco imagines that he has decoded the schematic structure of a Jean-Luc Godard film and creates a kind of Mad Lib style plot generator.

## Getting Started

If you're reading this, you've probably already created an account on Glitch. Next you have to "remix" this project, which clones it to your own account.
From there you can begin editing the files. There are three files you'll need to work with at a minimum.

### index.html

index.html is the HTML file that contains standard HTML. You'll definitely want to change the title, button text, and about section, at a minimum.

### grammar.js

The grammar.js file contains your actual RiTa grammar. Check out Daniel Howe's [documentation on grammars in RiTa](https://observablehq.com/@dhowe/tut-rita-grammars). 

### style.css

The style.css file is where you change the look of your project. Even if you don't know CSS, you should be able to muck around enough to change fonts, colors, and margins.

You can find some tips on [styling CSS](https://courses.digitaldavidson.net/elit20/styling-tracery/) on one of my course sites.

### Assets

You can also drag and drop or upload images into the "assets" folder to include in your project.

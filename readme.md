# Don't Drink the Water

_Don't Drink the Water_ is small webtoy that uses Tracery to generate new ecological disasters.
I put together the files here on Glitch as templates for students in my Electronic Literature class at Davidson College to use.

## Getting Started

If you're reading this, you've probably already created an account on Glitch. Next you have to "remix" this project, which clones it to your own account.
From there you can begin editing the files. There are three files you'll need to work with at a minimum.

### index.html

index.html is the HTML file that contains standard HTML. You'll definitely want to change the title, button text, and about section, at a minimum.

### grammar.js

This files contains your actual Tracery grammar. I recommend using a tool like Kate Compton's [Visual Tracery Editor](https://www.brightspiral.com/tracery/) while you're beginning to learn Tracery.
